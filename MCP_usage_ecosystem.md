## 🚀 Getting Started for Developers

To use our MCP server in their applications, developers would:

1. **Install the MCP SDK** for their platform
2. **Configure connection** to our swarm-provenance-mcp server
3. **Use available tools** (purchase_stamp, upload_data, etc.)
4. **Build workflows** around decentralized data storage

The beauty of MCP is that it provides a **standardized interface** - any MCP-compatible AI tool can immediately use our Swarm provenance functionality without custom integration work.

This makes our server valuable across a wide ecosystem of AI-powered applications, from simple desktop tools to complex enterprise systems.

## 📋 Available MCP Tools

Our Swarm Provenance MCP server currently provides these tools:

- `purchase_stamp` - Create new postage stamps for data uploads
- `get_stamp_status` - Check stamp details and utilization
- `list_stamps` - View all available stamps
- `extend_stamp` - Add funds to existing stamps
- `upload_data` - Store data on Swarm network (4KB limit)
- `download_data` - Retrieve data from Swarm by reference
- `health_check` - Verify gateway and network connectivity

## 🔗 Integration Examples

### **Research Workflow:**
1. AI agent purchases stamp for data storage
2. Uploads research dataset with metadata
3. Shares Swarm reference for peer verification
4. Maintains immutable record of data provenance

### **Content Verification:**
1. Journalist uploads source documents
2. AI verifies document integrity over time
3. Provides tamper-proof evidence chains
4. Enables transparent fact-checking processes

### **Development Pipeline:**
1. CI/CD system stores build artifacts
2. Maintains version history on decentralized storage
3. Provides audit trails for software supply chain
4. Enables reproducible builds with verified dependencies
